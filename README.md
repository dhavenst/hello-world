First Try
I am a professional programmer working at Kansas State University.  I am married with one grown son.  My main hobby is reading.  My work involves PeopleSoft Human Resouces sqrs that we need version control for.  We have been using Harvest as a Report Repository, but because of budget cuts we are looking for a lower cost platform.
